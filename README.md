# NN-Implementation
A neural network implementation from scratch using Python, without pre-built libraries or frameworks. This project aims to build a neural network framework focusing on core concepts and hands-on understanding.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network framework built from the ground up. The goal is to understand the underlying mechanics of neural networks by manually implementing key components such as layers, activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions.

This project concerns validation techniques that were used on real regression data as a way of testing the correctness of the implementation.
