The final model is a Neural Network with 5 layers, containing, respectively, 150 units in each of the four hidden layers and 3 units in the output layer. As activation functions for the hidden layers we used 'SeLU' and for the output layer the 'Identity' function. We used grid searches for model selection and an hold out set (drawn at the start of the project) to estimate the MEE on unseen data.
